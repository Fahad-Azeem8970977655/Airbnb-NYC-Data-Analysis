# Airbnb-NYC-Data-Analysis
NYC Airbnb Data Analysis explores pricing, availability, and neighborhood trends using the Airbnb Open Data. We apply data cleaning, EDA, and visualization techniques with interactive dashboards built in Streamlit. The project provides insights into factors influencing prices, popular areas, and guest preferences in New York City.
